            In 4th grade, my mom brought me to a sip and paint party. As we entered the studio,
everyone walked over to view the example painting on the instructor’s easel. It was a lovely
moonlight on the water scene, detailed with incandescent fireflies dancing among swaying
grasses. The party was getting situated - aprons tied around waists, paints pumped onto
plates, cups filled with chardonnay. Class began. The instructor guided us through the colors on
our pallet: blue, white, yellow, and black. We would be mixing and blending these colors to
create a range of shades for the different elements of our painting. I was entranced by the
creamy butter-like texture of the acrylic paint that smoothed itself under my brush. I diligently
painted along with every step: first was the yellow moon in the corner, then around its
periphery a light periwinkle, eventually transitioning into a deep midnight blue sky. There was
something so unassuming about the activity; it was as simple as following along, mimicking
the technique of the instructor’s brushstroke, trying to fill in every crevice of the canvas. I was
enamored.

            Days after, my anticipation for the next opportunity to engage in this activity could no
longer contain itself-- I had to do it on my own. After a run to the arts and crafts store for
supplies, and searching through Youtube for “acrylic painting tutorials for beginners,” I got
down to business. As the person teaching through the screen conveyed unfamiliar names too
advanced for what I could deal with at the time (“alizarin crimson,” “burnt umber,” “phthalo
blue”), I did my best to align what I could with my Apple Barrel Craft paints. I experimented
with pressure, with the twisting and turning, with bold, generous strokes to try and achieve the
same effect as the brush I saw on screen. Throughout the summer before 5th grade, my days
were filled with the run-through of dozens of Youtube tutorials, each new masterpiece handed
to my mom to hang up somewhere on our crowding walls. Each canvas was plastered over
with a fresh concept - bird lover silhouettes, a sunset in Paris, blue wildflower fields,
dreamcatchers in the wind - certainly, my paintings were by no means original artworks, but the feeling of overwhelming anticipation to create something that was my own was all that
mattered. Days turned into weeks into months into years that this process would continue, but
my own personal approach and my own style emerged during the journey, and I found myself
applying the stockpile of techniques, tips, and perspectives that I had accumulated over the
years on my own.

            Last year, when the pandemic hit, I thought I’d try something new. I started hosting
painting classes through Zoom. Now, I was the one transmitting painting jargon through the
screen. My attendees were initially young children, but soon enough, moms, dads and
sometimes whole families together, started painting along too. Recreating scenes as simple as
a lavender farm, a lily pond, hot air balloons, among others, draws out a pure, seemingly
child-like passion in those who lose themselves in the activity. The demands of work, to-do lists
and calendar deadlines are drowned out when we allow ourselves to focus on what’s in front
of us. I’ve had adults message me about how the class has been for them a source of relaxation
at the end of a long week. A parent has told me how their kid has begun to love art-related
activities so much more after taking the classes. Unlike many of the tasks we complete,
painting isn’t something that’s done to be done with. It’s as if there is something about the act
that is imbued with a sense of hidden magic, the kind that captivates no matter the age of the
individual. That’s something that I never intend to lose.

      Conversation Cue Cards (C3 For Me) is a platform designed to foster meaningful conversations for students with disabilities and neurodiverse individuals, enabling them to articulate their aspirations and strengths.
      <br/><br/>
Tasked with the challenge of translating this concept into a tangible digital experience, I spearheaded the software development phase. Collaborating closely with the Founder and CEO of C3forMe, Dr. Janae Duclos, and special education professionals, we created an intuitive application tailored for its unique audience.
<br/><br/>
In a focused development cycle, we rolled out a web application that not only offers a diverse range of prompts and cues but also allows students to record and revisit their dialogues.

      C3forMe targets teens and adults with neurodisabilities, many of whom are assisted and guided by educators, mentors, and parents. Informed by my personal experiences tutoring a student with Autism and insights from special education professionals, we identified key user needs:
      <br/><br/>
      <i className="text-gray-500">Clarity, Consistency, and Routine</i>: Students with neurodisabilities often thrive on consistency and predictability. Their preference for routine highlights the importance of intuitive and reliable environments.
      <br/><br/>
      <i className="text-gray-500">Rethinking Transition Planning</i>: Existing transition planning models spotlight a significant power dynamic. For instance, long-form surveys, which lack genuine dialogue, often place teachers or mentors in a dominant role, with students largely relegated to passive listening. Recognizing this imbalance, there is an evident need to transition from this one-sided approach to a more equitable dialogue-driven framework.

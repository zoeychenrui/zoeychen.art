      Conversation Cue Cards (C3 For Me) is a platform designed to foster meaningful conversations for students with disabilities and neurodiverse individuals, enabling them to articulate their aspirations and strengths.
      <br/><br/>
Tasked with the challenge of translating this concept into a tangible digital experience, I spearheaded the software development phase. Collaborating closely with the Founder and CEO of C3forMe, Dr. Janae Duclos, and special education professionals, we created an intuitive application tailored for its unique audience.
<br/><br/>
In a focused development cycle, we rolled out a web application that not only offers a diverse range of prompts and cues but also allows students to record and revisit their dialogues.

      I‚Äôm Zoey, a Duke undergrad studying Computational Media, a fusion of computer science and visual media studies‚Äîwhich has been fruitful. 
    <br/><br/>
    I see a future where technology not only serves us but truly understands us, creating personalized experiences that respond to individual needs and make us feel <i>more</i> human. That's the frontier I hope to explore and contribute to.

    I will always point my love of design and creation back to my roots in art. Growing up, my favorite pastime was painting and DIYing. Painting pet portraits was a simple but meaningful way to connect with people. (I would gladly paint your pet!)
    <br/><br/>
    When I'm not coding or creating art, I like to spend my time 
    <br/>
    going on long walks,
    <br/>
    making talk (‚Äúwow, that got deep really fast‚Äù), 
    <br/>
    washing fruit (probably red seedless grapes),
    <br/>
    experimenting with racquet sports (pickleball is the <a href="https://today.duke.edu/2023/04/crazie-pickleball-duke" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="cursor-pointer link-item text-[#3ABAB4]">community-gatherer</a> at Duke),
    <br/>
    organizing a <a href="https://www.dukeunccls.com/ " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="cursor-pointer link-item text-[#3ABAB4]">conference</a> on U.S.-China relations,
    <br/>
    changing up my study space on campus,
    <br/>
 & most importantly, doing life with the lovely humans in all corners of my life ü©µ

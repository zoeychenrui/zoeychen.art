      Hi, my name is Zoey Chen and I'm a Duke undergrad studying Computational Media, a fusion of computer science and visual media studiesâ€”which has been fruitful. 
    <br/><br/>
    I point my love of design and creative development back to my roots in art. Growing up, my favorite pastime was painting and DIYing. Painting pet portraits was a simple but meaningful way to connect with people. (I would gladly paint your pet!)
    <br/><br/>
    When I'm not coding or creating art, I like to spend my time 
    <br/>
    going on long walks,
    <br/>
    engaging in talks ("wow, that got deep pretty fast"),
    <br/>
    experimenting with racquet sports (pickleball is the <a href="https://today.duke.edu/2023/04/crazie-pickleball-duke" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="cursor-pointer link-item text-[#3ABAB4]">community-gatherer</a> at Duke),
    <br/>
    changing up my study space on and off campus,
    <br/>
    cherishing fellowship at <a href="https://www.makenewnc.org/?utm_source=wordpress#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="cursor-pointer link-item text-[#3ABAB4]">church</a>,
    <br/>
    and in all of the above, doing life with the lovely people I've been blessed with in all corners of my life ðŸ©µ

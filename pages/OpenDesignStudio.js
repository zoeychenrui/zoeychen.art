          PROJECT OVERVIEW

      <div className="mt-6 text-gray-800 font-light text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-xl ">
      Open Design Studio operates at the intersection of education, innovation, and equity. As a hub within Duke University, it fosters a collaboration between educators, students, and community partners, using open design to address societal challenges.
      <br/><br/>
      Guided by the principles of open design, I crafted visually compelling graphics that embody its ethos. My contributions included devising a new logo and designing distinct templates for documents and slides that serve as educational resources on open design methodology.

          LOGO EXPLORATIONS
      </div>
      <div className="mt-6 text-gray-800 font-light text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-xl ">
      For the Open Design Studio logo, I explored numerous iterations. The goal was to capture the open design process's recursive nature and its interconnected phases, symbolized by four distinct colors. This exploration was crucial in moving beyond the earlier logo's constraints, highlighting both the iterative process and the collaboration inherent to Open Design.

          FINAL LOGO
      </div>
      <div className="mt-6 text-gray-800 font-light text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-xl ">
      The finalized logo for the Open Design Studio embodies connectedness, movement, and unity—elements that the director particularly appreciated. Its geometric intricacy and a central open space combine to offer a fresh, modern look. At its core, a star shape stands out, serving as a symbol of open design's guiding values of active inclusivity, transparency, and collaboration. These values, like stars, serve as aspirational markers, guiding the shared journey towards transformation.
